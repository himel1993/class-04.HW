<p>Fiverr celebrated ten years at the beginning of this year. When we started the company back in 2010, it was the year marking a decade in which freelancing became mainstream, widely chosen by many worldwide as a way of life and used by many businesses to get things done.</p>
<p>We believe that 2020 marks the beginning of a decade in which freelancing will take another step forward, a decade in which businesses will learn how to effectively integrate freelancers into their workflows and benefit from having access to the best talent in the world with just a few clicks.</p>
